ALX practice assignments for working with the Redis database

## exercise.py - Writing strings to Redis

Create a Cache class. In the `__init__` method, store an instance of the Redis client as a private variable named `_redis` (using `redis.Redis()`) and flush the instance using `flushdb`.

Create a `store` method that takes a `data` argument and returns a string. The method should generate a random key (e.g. using `uuid`), store the input data in Redis using the random key and return the key.

## exercise.py - Reading from Redis and recovering original type

Redis only allows to store string, bytes and numbers (and lists thereof). Whatever you store as single elements, it will be returned as a byte string. Hence if you store "a" as a UTF-8 string, it will be returned as b"a" when retrieved from the server.

In this exercise we will create a `get` method that take a `key` string argument and an optional `Callable` argument named `fn`. This callable will be used to convert the data back to the desired format.

Also, implement 2 new methods: `get_str` and `get_int` that will automatically parametrize `Cache.get` with the correct conversion function.
